# Weâ€™ll be using experience replay memory for training our DQN.
#  It stores the transitions that the agent observes,
# allowing us to reuse this data later.
# By sampling from it randomly, the transitions that build up a batch are decorrelated.
# It has been shown that this greatly stabilizes and improves the DQN training procedure.
